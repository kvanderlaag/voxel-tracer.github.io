## A New Blog

Welcome to my development blog, where I plan to share whatever I learn while working on my side projects (more on that in a future post). My general direction is toward a cuda-based voxel renderer.

I've already been working on some prototypes to learn more about cuda, and my plan now is to focus on specific problems to solve and write small cuda programs that build on one another. 

I will be sharing the full source code in my github (link on top of the page) and also I will writing blog posts explaining whatever subject that takes me some time to figure out.
